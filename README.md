# Proposal
## Xu Wensong
## 1.	Project Description
This project is going to predict human wine taste preferences from physicochemical properties which are easily obtained through analytical tests.

## 2.	Attribution Information:
Input variables (based on physicochemical tests): 
1 - fixed acidity 
2 - volatile acidity 
3 - citric acid 
4 - residual sugar 
5 - chlorides 
6 - free sulfur dioxide 
7 - total sulfur dioxide 
8 - density 
9 - pH 
10 - sulphates 
11 - alcohol 
Output variable (based on sensory data): 
12 - quality (score between 0 and 10)

## 3.	Methods
1)	I will test if there are some variables that are missing or inefficient and delete them;
2)	Test if it is practicable to do dimensionality reduction;
3)	I will do collinearity or other algorithms about feature selecting to choose several features;
4)	I plan to use SVM / KNN /Decision tree to find the most suitable algorithm.
