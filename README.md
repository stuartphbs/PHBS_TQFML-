# PHBS_TQFML-Project
# Proposal
## Xu Wensong
## 1.	Project Description
This project is going to predict human wine taste preferences from physicochemical properties which are easily obtained through analytical tests.

## 2.	Attribution Information:
Input variables (based on physicochemical tests): 
<br>1 - fixed acidity 
<br>2 - volatile acidity 
<br>3 - citric acid 
<br>4 - residual sugar 
<br>5 - chlorides 
<br>6 - free sulfur dioxide 
<br>7 - total sulfur dioxide 
<br>8 - density 
<br>9 - pH 
<br>10 - sulphates 
<br>11 - alcohol 
<br>Output variable (based on sensory data): 
<br>12 - quality (score between 0 and 10)

## 3.	Methods
1)	I will test if there are some variables that are missing or inefficient and delete them;
2)	Test if it is practicable to do dimensionality reduction;
3)	I will do collinearity or other algorithms about feature selecting to choose several features;
4)	I plan to use SVM / KNN /Decision tree to find the most suitable algorithm.
