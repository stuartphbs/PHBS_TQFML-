# PHBS_TQFML-Project
# Proposal
## Xu Wensong
## 1.	Project Description
This project is use the training set containing 28736 images of fruits to train a classification model, and use the model to classify the test dataset. Finanly, by training differnet models, we could find the most promosing one.

## 2.	dataset propoerties:
<br>There are abundant high-quality imagines about fruits. These imagines are filmed by a Logitech C920 camera and each imagine has a white sheet as backgroud.

<br>Training set size: 28736 images.

<br>Validation set size: 9673 images.

<br>Number of classes: 60 (fruits).

## 3.	Methods
1)	using PCA/t-SNE to preprocess the image datasets
2)  training Random Forest Classifier/ KNN/ SVM/ BP model by the datasets obtained above
3)  Visualizing the dataset/outcome if possible
4)  evaluating the most promising model in classifying fruits.
